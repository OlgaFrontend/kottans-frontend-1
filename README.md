Nice to advance my git skills

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

Now I won't be lost when I have to deal with PATH when setting up my dev env. I always had some issues with it.

I've had some knoledge about HTTP before reading the articles but I didn't have clear understanding of different request or response message headers. That's something I'll use in the future. I was kind of surprised to find out about some less used request verbs (TRACE, OPTIONS).
I've also got a better deeper understanding of connection handling and HTTP caching mechanisms. I've found out new different ways of identification (knew only Cookies before that) which I can use in the future.

## Git Collaboration

The courses helped me learn git in details. I often had problems with resolving conflictes after the merge and resetting commits. Squashing commits is something I'll definetelly try in the future.

I didn't know about some responsive patterns.
I've used flexbox before but somehow I've missed `flex-wrap: wrap-reverse` property. The last level was tricky :)

## JS Basics

Udacity course was quite good in overview having some practice but codeCamp gave a good opportunity to put into practise JS knowledge. The exercises were pretty tricky at some point.

## DOM

I liked the Udacity course and I hope I've become a bit better in algorithms.

The course clarified a lot of stuff from OOP for me.
