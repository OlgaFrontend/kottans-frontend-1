## Linux CLI, and HTTP
Completed CLI course screenshot: http://take.ms/xTI8n

Now I won't be lost when I have to deal with PATH when setting up my dev env. I always had some issues with it.

I've had some knoledge about HTTP before reading the articles but I didn't have clear understanding of different request or response message headers. That's something I'll use in the future. I was kind of surprised to find out about some less used request verbs (TRACE, OPTIONS).
I've also got a better deeper understanding of connection handling and HTTP caching mechanisms. I've found out new different ways of identification (knew only Cookies before that) which I can use in the future.
